# Les Recettes Wild : A Student's Guide to Easy-Making Recipes

## Overview
This project, "Les Recettes Wild", is the first group project by web development students after one month of studying code. Built by three people over a two-week period, it is designed to suggest easy-to-make recipes for students who don't have much time to cook. The primary aim is to develop technical skills in HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript.
